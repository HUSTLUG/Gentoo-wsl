## Overview

This repository provides an unofficial, continuously updated **`.wsl` package** that lets you install Gentoo on Windows with a single command:

```powershell
wsl --install gentoo          # once our PR is merged into microsoft/WSL
````

For manual installation or testing:

```powershell
wsl --install --from-file gentoo_YYYY-MM-DD.wsl
```

The root-filesystem is built from the latest **stage3-amd64-openrc** snapshot, pre-configured with:

* Interactive **OOBE** that creates your first user (UID 1000, in `wheel` group)
* `sudo` pre-installed and `%wheel` enabled
* `wsl.conf` tuned for `/mnt` automount with `metadata`
---

## Usage

1. Download the latest release from [https://github.com/hlug-hust/gentoo-wsl/releases](https://github.com/hlug-hust/gentoo-wsl/releases).
2. Run

   ```powershell
   wsl --install --from-file gentoo_YYYY-MM-DD.wsl
   ```
3. Follow the OOBE prompt to create your user and set a password.
4. On subsequent launches you will drop directly into that user account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlug-hust/gentoo-wsl.git

./build_gentoo_wsl.sh                 # fetches stage3, installs sudo, packs .wsl
